+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* Part A -> uarray2 *
the puspose of this function is to create a usable two dimentional array. this 
will be implimented in other files to allow for creating grids to hold info on
specific tasks or to simply hold double arrays.

* Part B -> bit2 *
the purpose of this is to create a double array of bits that can be used to 
represent greyscale images by creating a grid using ones and zeros. this can 
then be used to manipulate several images and create them. 

* Part C -> sudoku *
 the purpose of this file is to create a program that checks to see if a sudoku
puzzle is solved correctly. that is it is a 9 by 9 grid, max intesnty of 9, min
of 1 in each row and column no to pixels have the same intensity, and there are
3 by 3 submaps with no pixels of the same intensity. 

* Part D -> unblackedges *
the purpose of this file is to create a program that takes in an image then it
goes through the pixelage of the image finding the black edges and turning them
into white edges. then returning the same image with the same dimesntions but
with no black edges.

* Part A -> uarray2 * 
for this program we used a uarray and filled it with pointers to other arrays. 
this created the ability to create a doubel array of multiple dimentions by 
changging the width and height and or colomn size or rows. 

* Part B -> bit2 *
for this program we ussed a uarray and filled it with pointers to bit arrays
similar to part a this allows for a double array of bits to form that can be 
manipulated by height and width or row and column size.

* Part C -> sudoku *
for this program we created a double array that takes int the sudoku and checks
to see if it is solved. it does this by creating a double array and placing in 
the then it loops through to see if any row or colunm has the same number then
sees if any sub grid of three by three doesn not have any of the same numbers
then it declairs it as solved and exits with 0 and if it doesnt it exits with 1

* Part D -> unblackedges *
for this program we created a double array of bits that is made of an image 
imported. them we move thought the outside crid of the image and locating black
edges and turning them to white but marking how much of the exposed edges are
black bits as well. after it is done it then returns the image from the double
bit array to a an image with out black edges.
